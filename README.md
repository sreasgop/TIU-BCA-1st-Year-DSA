# 📚 TIU-UCA-L116 Programming in Data Structure through C++ Lab

Welcome to the TIU-UCA-L116 repository, which contains all the questions and solutions implemented in C++ for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. This course is taught in the first year of the BCA Hons Course at Techno India University during the second semester.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository consists of one folder and one text file. The folder `Solutions` contains all the C++ source code files, each named according to the question number. The text file contains all the questions or problem statements, also numbered accordingly.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use the Source Code

To utilize the source code, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can use any C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard or later, such as GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio.

### Installing GCC on Various Operating Systems:

#### Windows:

- Download MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
- Run the installer and select the necessary components, including the GCC compiler
- Add MinGW/bin to your system path
- Open a command prompt and type `g++ --version` to verify that GCC is installed

#### Linux:

- Most Linux distributions come with GCC pre-installed. If not, you can use your package manager to install it
- For example, on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can use `sudo apt-get install g++`
- On Fedora or Red Hat-based systems, you can use `sudo yum install gcc-c++`
- Open a terminal and type `g++ --version` to verify that GCC is installed

#### Mac:

- You can install Xcode (Apple's development environment) from [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- Xcode comes with the Clang compiler, which supports C++
- Open a terminal and type `g++ --version` to verify that the compiler is installed

### Compiling and Running C++ Programs:

To compile a C++ program using GCC, you can use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o output_file input_file.cpp
```
where output_file is the name of the executable file that will be generated and input_file.c is the name of the source code file that contains your program.

### To run a C++ program after compiling using gcc, you need to use the following command:

```bash
./output_file
```

where output_file is the name of the executable file that was generated by gcc. You may need to add `./` before output_file to indicate that it is in the current directory.
